# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe project! This simple web-based game is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It's a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of three marks in a row.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game board will be displayed with a 3x3 grid.
3. Player 1 starts by clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X).
4. Player 2 follows, placing their mark (O) in an empty cell.
5. The game continues until one player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the board is filled (resulting in a draw).
